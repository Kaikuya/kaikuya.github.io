    <h1>Honkai Star Rail</h1>
    
    <p>
        One of the games I find interesting is <strong>Honkai Star Rail</strong>. I started playing this game one month after the intial release and from then on, I have reach the end game where I just farm materials for my character. My favorite character in this game is Firefly / Sam because she is an awesome character with a Mech Suit. Below here is a picture of her. You can learn more about them on the <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/"></a>.</p>
